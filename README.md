# SocialNetworkInfiltration

This project revolves around the implementation of different algorithms 
and data structures in C to perform various manipulations to data from a 
dataset of that consists of around 70,000 messages extracted from a 
fictional social network. In this implementation there was a focus in code 
eficiency and memory usage, resulting in a good execution performance and 
0 memory leaks. Future work may include addind the ability for the code to 
be executed in parallel or rewrite this project in Rust and compare the 
performance.
