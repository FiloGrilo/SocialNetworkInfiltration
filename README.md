# SocialNetworkInfiltration

This project revolves around the implementation of different algorithms 
and data structures in C to perform various manipulations to data from a 
dataset that consists of around 70,000 messages extracted from a 
fictional social network. In this implementation there was a focus in code 
eficiency and memory usage, resulting in a good execution performance and 
0 memory leaks. Future work may include addind the ability for the code to 
be executed in parallel or rewrite this project in Rust and compare the 
performance.

This project was done by me and [Tiago 
Silv√©rio](https://github.com/tiagosilveriom).
